# Hello_World
This is my tutorial and introduction to GitHub and how it works. I'm excited to learn and looking forward to working in Github.

My full name is Stephanus Cornelis, but all my friends call me bro or corras. My parrents call me Corn√© which is short for Cornelis.
I love swimming competitivly and I believe I can swim away from a shark.
